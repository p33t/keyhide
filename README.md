# keyhidegen
Tool for generating a keyhide HTML file

This application can be used at: https://keyhidegen.freshcode.biz

## Background
Sometimes you need to reproduce a random series of characters or 'key' but you don't want to write it down, and you can't remember it.
A 'keyhide' contains the key but you need to know the coordinates to extract it.

This is similar to a physical [key lock box](https://www.google.com/search?q=key+lock+box&tbm=isch).

Try out a [simple example key hide](https://keyhidegen.freshcode.biz/example.html) (Click B2 then H2).
