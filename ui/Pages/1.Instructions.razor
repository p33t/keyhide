    This online tool will produce a grid of random characters which contains a secret string of characters, or <b>key</b>.
    The key can be retrieved by tracing a sequence of known coordinates within the grid.
</p>
<p>
    Try out a <a href="example.html">simple example key hide</a> (Click B2 then H2).
</p>
<p>
    Follow the instructions to produce a standalone HTML page which can be saved online.
    Then you'll have access to your secret key while knowing only the online location and the sequence of grid coordinates.
</p>
<p>
    For security purposes, <b>your secret key never leaves this computer</b>.
    Feel free to disconnect network access while using this tool.
